# CML-EIGRP-INE-TOPOLOGY
I have been studying for CCNP ENCOR using INE. I love how indept their lectures are, but I was missing a bit of hands on for some of it. I took some time to creatre a similar topology to what INE uses for the EIGRP lectures including the tunnel so I could follow along. 

The file attached is a YAML file that you can use to upload onto Cisco Modeling Labs (CML) to follow along with INE's EIGRP lectures. 

If you don't have CML you can acquire it here https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/modeling-labs/index.html#~licensing It is a paid product and the license is good for up to one year. The great thing in comparison to GNS3 and EVE-NG is that CML comes with a great deal of IOS images ready to go. This will be necessary for my YAML file to load successfully on CML. 

If you are interrested in enrolling in INE CCNP ENCOR Course you can find that here https://my.ine.com/Networking/learning-paths/04e78954-b839-4484-8bd8-94c4e8779c72/enterprise-core-exam-350-401-encor 

I hope that this is useful for you, and much as it has been for me. 

To upload the file, go to your CML Dashboard, and click Import on the top right. Then Select the YAML file and stanr the lab.
